# Quantium-Data-Analysis-Internship

![]()

## Overview

In my internship program, I focused on two core areas of Quantium business: data analytics and software engineering. I gained insights into how each capability empowers Quantium clients to make more informed and data-driven decisions.

Through this program, I had the opportunity to explore the diverse range of work Quantium undertake across multiple industries. This experience provided a deep understanding of analytics from an industry leader's perspective. I learned how to apply commercial thinking to various types of work, gaining valuable insights into the world of analytics.

## Task 1

As a member of Quantium's retail analytics team, I was tasked by the Category Manager for Chips to analyze customer purchasing behavior related to Chips within the region. The insights gathered would significantly influence the strategic plan for the chip category over the next six months at the supermarket.

My manager, Zilinka, provided guidance via email to ensure success in this task:

Zilinka emphasized the importance of examining transaction and customer data thoroughly. I was instructed to identify inconsistencies, missing data, outliers, and ensure correct categorization and numeric consistency across all tables. Cleaning the data was crucial for a reliable analysis.

Upon examining the customer data for similar issues and resolving them, I merged the transaction and customer data to prepare it for analysis, saving the files at each step to maintain progress.

Moving to data analysis, Zilinka stressed defining metrics, such as total sales and sales drivers, investigating sales distribution, and uncovering significant trends or insights through charts and graphs. These findings would contribute to our report to Julia.

A deeper dive into customer segments was the subsequent step. I was to recommend target segments based on insights and determine the relevance of packet sizes. Formulating an overall conclusion based on the analysis was vital
