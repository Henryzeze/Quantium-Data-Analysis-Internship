# Quantium-Data-Analysis-Internship

![]()

## Overview

In my internship program, I focused on two core areas of Quantium business: data analytics and software engineering. I gained insights into how each capability empowers Quantium clients to make more informed and data-driven decisions.

Through this program, I had the opportunity to explore the diverse range of work Quantium undertake across multiple industries. This experience provided a deep understanding of analytics from an industry leader's perspective. I learned how to apply commercial thinking to various types of work, gaining valuable insights into the world of analytics.

## Task 1

As a member of Quantium's retail analytics team, I was tasked by the Category Manager for Chips to analyze customer purchasing behavior related to Chips within the region. The insights gathered would significantly influence the strategic plan for the chip category over the next six months at the supermarket.

My manager, Zilinka, provided guidance via email to ensure success in this task:

Zilinka emphasized the importance of examining transaction and customer data thoroughly. I was instructed to identify inconsistencies, missing data, outliers, and ensure correct categorization and numeric consistency across all tables. Cleaning the data was crucial for a reliable analysis.

Upon examining the customer data for similar issues and resolving them, I merged the transaction and customer data to prepare it for analysis, saving the files at each step to maintain progress.

Moving to data analysis, Zilinka stressed defining metrics, such as total sales and sales drivers, investigating sales distribution, and uncovering significant trends or insights through charts and graphs. These findings would contribute to our report to Julia.

A deeper dive into customer segments was the subsequent step. I was to recommend target segments based on insights and determine the relevance of packet sizes. Formulating an overall conclusion based on the analysis was vital

### Data Cleaning and Analysis

The cleaning/transformation and analysis of the data was done using Python. Full details with explanations can be seen in the interactive Python notebook below.

### Insights

Sales had predominantly stemmed from budget-older families, Mainstream - young singles/couples, and Mainstream - retirees shoppers. Upon investigation, it was discovered that the heightened expenditure on chips among mainstream young singles/couples and retirees could be attributed to their larger population size compared to other buyers. Additionally, mainstream mid-age individuals and young singles/couples demonstrated a higher tendency to pay more per packet of chips, indicative of impulsive buying behavior.

Moreover, my analysis revealed that Mainstream young singles and couples exhibited a 22% higher likelihood of purchasing Tyrrells chips compared to the rest of the population. To boost the category's performance, the Category Manager might consider placing Tyrrells and smaller packs of chips in off-location areas closer to segments frequented by young singles and couples. This strategic placement aims to increase visibility and encourage impulse purchasing behavior. Quantium can offer support to the Category Manager by providing recommendations on these segments' locations and assisting in measuring the impact of altered placements.

## Task 2

In this phase of the project, my task was to evaluate the impact of the new trial layouts and provide data-driven recommendations regarding whether these trial layouts should be implemented across all stores. Zilinka, the Category Manager for Chips, outlined specific areas of focus and expectations for this analysis.

Zilinka emphasized the following key points:

- Selection of control stores: I was tasked with exploring the data and defining metrics to select suitable control stores. The goal was to identify stores that would serve as effective control groups, ensuring comparability with the trial stores. Visualizing the drivers and metrics was crucial to determine the suitability of these control stores. I also considered the creation of a function to streamline this selection process.

- Assessment of the trial: I was required to thoroughly analyze each trial store individually in comparison to its respective control store. The aim was to gain insights into the overall performance of each trial store and determine whether the trials were successful or not.

- Collating findings: My final task involved summarizing the findings for each store and providing clear recommendations that could be shared with Julia, outlining the impact of the trial layouts on sales during the trial period.

It was crucial to remember the significance of visualizations when presenting findings to the client. I ensured to save all generated visualizations for later use in the report. The deadline for submitting the analysis was set for mid-next week to allow ample time for discussion and report compilation before the client presentation scheduled in three weeks.

### Analysis

Analysis of the data was done using Python. Full details with explanations can be seen in the interactive Python notebook below.

### Insights

I found control stores 233, 155, and 178 for trial stores 77, 86, and 88, respectively.

The results for trial store 77 during the trial period showed a significant difference in at least two of the three trial months, but this was not the case for trial store 86. I considered checking with the client if the implementation of the trial was different in trial store 86. However, overall, the trial showed a significant increase in sales. After finishing our analysis, I prepared my presentation for the Category Manager.
